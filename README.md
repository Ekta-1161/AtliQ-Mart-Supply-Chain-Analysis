## Problem statement

AtliQ Mart is a growing FMCG manufacturer headquartered in Gujarat, India. It is currently operational in three cities Surat, Ahmedabad and Vadodra. They want to expand to other metro/tier1 cities in the next 2 years.

AtliQ Mart is currently facing a problem where a few key customers did not extend the annual contract due to service issues. It is speculated that some of the essential products were either not delivered on time or not delivered in full over a continued period, which could have resulted in bad customer service. Management wants to fix this issue before expanding to other cities and requested their supply chain analytics team to track the ’On time’ and ‘In Full’ delivery service level for all the customers on a daily basis so that they can respond swiftly to these issues.

The Supply Chain team decided to use a standard approach to measure the service level in which they will measure ‘on-time delivery (OT) %’, ‘In-full delivery (IF) %’ and OnTime in full (OTIF) % of the customer orders on a daily basis against the target service level set for each customer.

## Task:

Peter Pandey is the data analyst in the supply chain team who joined Atliq Mart recently. He has been briefed about the the task in the stakeholder business review meeting. Now Imagine yourself as Peter Pandey and play the role of the new data analyst who is excited to build this dashboard and perform the following task

## Some Major Insights

We can see that Surat is doing great as compared to the other cities in terms of OTIF (On Time & In Full) order Deliveries and Vadodara is not doing well as compared to the other cities in terms of OTIF (On Time & In Full) order deliveries and Vadodara has the highest undelivered orders as well.

In all city AtliQ Mart has average 29.54% OTIF Orders. OT%, IF% & OTIF% are way below their target value.

Amul Milk have highest Qty Order in all cities and Amul Ghee has Lowest Qty Order. By the product category, Dairy products have highest Order value.

The Order Qty and delivered Qty is differ by 4.60 lakhs, so average volume fill rate achieved 96.59%.

The most profitable customer is Vijay Store, because Vijay Store has placed the highest order among all customers.

'Acclaimed Stores' and 'CoolBlue' Stores have highest difference with overall Matrix and their Target Value which lead to business loss. So, these two Customer need attentions to increase OTIF%.
